# Driver-Drowsiness-And-Intoxication-Detection-System
Driver drowsiness detection is a technology which alerts drivers if he/she is getting drowsy and prevents road accidents.In this paper an efficient way to detect driver drowsiness  system is developed to ensure safety of drivers  on the road .
The falling sleep state of the driver acts as the sign of drowsiness and to achieve high accuracy and fastness Convolutional Neural Networks[1] (CNN)  is used.  
The system developed here identified key attributes of drowsiness such as eye closure, yawning, and fatigue in drivers .
The system also  detected intoxication using pupil movements.
Alert was generated based on eye detections and warnings on drowsiness were given based on yawning and pupil movement tracking for intoxication.
